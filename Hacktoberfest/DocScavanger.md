**Doc Scavenger** is a HacktoberFest online program organized by the Technical Writers focus group in CHAOSS Africa. This event in clear terms is basically the scavenging (scouting) for issues, bugs and fixing them within documents in CHAOSS Repositories, Projects and Open Source at large. However it is safe to note that the team has provided issues that are classified as Hacktober Fest Worthy and you can find these issues in [CHAOSS Africa Github Repository](https://github.com/chaoss/chaoss-africa) repositories labeled accordingly.
